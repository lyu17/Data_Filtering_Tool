# Data Filtering and Anomaly Detection for Extreme Scale Systems

This project is dedicated to designing and developing an extensive software infrastructure to provide online system monitoring, diagnosing, and predicting for large-scale systems. The goal is to enhance existing resilience technologies as well as to facilitate new resilience techniques. There are two components included in this repository: (1) data filtering, which includes both java implementation (needs to be run with Weka library) and matlab implementation; (2) anomaly detection, which includes both C+MPI implementation and matlab implementation.
