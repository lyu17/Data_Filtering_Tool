# Online System Monitoring, Diagnosing,and Predicting for Large-Scale Computing
This project is dedicated to designing and developing an extensive software infrastructure to provide online system monitoring, diagnosing, and predicting for large-scale systems. The goal is to enhance existing resilience technologies as well as to facilitate new resilience techniques. Our major research tasks include effective log preprocessing, online failure prediction, automated anomaly diagnosis, and reliability-aware modeling. The work was selected for the Top-10 Data Mining Case Studies at the 10th ICDM. The team also won "The Cray Log Analysis Contest" at the First USENIX Workshop on the Analysis of System Logs (WASL'08), which was co-located with the 8th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI'08), December 8-10, 2008.
